Welcome to my highsteamus/README.md stuff, I appreciate ur wasting ur time on this unnecessary actions.

I'm that one guy who develops a huge Game-Dev project called Soul Reveal, well yet having other projects like SILVER: Chariots & Sorcerers (but it seems that guy doesn't care about it's existance.)
if u want to reach me u can DM me on discord : highsteam

can write stuff on Lua, Java, Javascript, C++ and C#
kinda great at Game Designing, Logos Creations, Game-Art, UI Art and Projects Management.
I only work for myself, because I see it takes my time working for someone's projects, not in need of money in future either way, so dont even try messaging me with such topics.
